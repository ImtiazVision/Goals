# Goals

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python are some of the languages we must learn as web developers. Then we can focus on either Front End or Back End web development, as well as game development. Then experiment with machine learning, embedded systems, cloud engineering, data science, and so on.

### Key things to remember

**Motto/Goal** : is to continuously strive to be a better version of ourselves than we were yesterday.
